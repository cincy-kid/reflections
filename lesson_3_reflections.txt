When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when you need to access the files form a different computer or
  when multiple people are working on the code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	in case you want to have a separate code set on your local
	computer and only update the files when ready.
